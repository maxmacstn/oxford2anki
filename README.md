![header](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/maxmacstn/oxford2anki/master/screenshots/ss1.png)

A simple Python script to convert lists of vocabularies to AnkiWeb cards. Words definitions are query from Oxford dictionaries API.

## usage
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Obtain `APP KEY` and `API KEY` from [Oxford Dictionaries API website](https://developer.oxforddictionaries.com/). 
Note: Free tier can query 1,000 request/month
3. Modify `credentials.py` and put your `APP KEY` and `API KEY` in it.
4. Prepare words/vocabularies files. Each line must contains only one word. Non-alphabet such as spaces, dashes, numbers are acceptable. This script will strip it out anyway. 
5. Run the script, it requires two options which is input file name and output file name respectively.
```
oxford2anki.py -i <inputfile> -o <outputfile>
```
6. Import output file to Anki, match it to your word and meaning field and voil√†!

If you still unsure how it works, hopefully [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-yxgUPfVe3Q) will help you.

## Comparisons to Mac OS Dictionary
Cards that are generated by this script will include every definition from the homograph of the word, lexical catagory, sense, subsense and example.
